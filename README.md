> Auto Update
> 
> Display [What's New]

### Installing HFW to your PlayStation 3.

On your computer, download the latest .PUP file from [here](https://www.ps3xploit.me/firmware/hfw/HFW_4.92.1_PS3UPDAT.PUP) and on your USB Stick make the following directories fom the root ```/PS3/UPDATE/``` and then paste the file you previously downloaded to the ```UPDATE``` folder and rename the file to ```PS3UPDAT.PUP```

After that is done, **eject** the USB Stick from your computer and plug it into your PlayStation 3. (Should see your USB pop up in the media bars on XMB)

On your PlayStation 3 scroll left to Settings and select ```System Update``` and ```Update via Storage Media``` and the HFW should pop up. Click OK, agree to the User Agreement and press **Start**. Now you can wait and it will install by it self.

After the initial installation you have to perform a secondary installation, this time in **safe mode**.

Completely shut down your console and Hold down the power button and it will beep a few times and turn off.
Then again, hold down the power button until you hear to quick beeps and then let go.

If you see text prompting you to connect a controller via USB that means you have succesfully entered **safe mode**.

Connect your controller and press the PS button in the middle and a menu will show having multiple options.

Scroll down all the way using the D-Pad and click on the ```System Update``` option with the X button on your controller.

Press both the Select and Start Buttons on your controller and it will start scanning for your USB Stick, if it has trouble finding it unplug your controller right after you press the buttons so it only detects the USB stick. If done properly it will detect the HFW and you can follow the steps to download it.

After its done, it will restart and boot into a HDMI screen, just select yes and you will be booted into the XMB.

## Installing PS3HEN
After you have finished installing HFW its time to download PS3HEN.

On your XMB go to the Network tab and click Internet Browser.
Press the start button to open the Adress text field.
In the text field type in  ```https://ps3xploit.me/``` and you will be taken to the PS3Xploit website, optionally, you can bookmark this tab for easier access.
After this is done, on the top of the screen, hover over the ```PS3HEN``` text written in white with your cursor and click the Auto HEN Installer and press the Auto Install HEN. You might have to do this a few times but after it is done PS3HEN will be successfully installed
